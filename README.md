# Teleprompter
Teleprompter is a customisable web app allowing users to read off their script.

> Currently a WIP

## Features
- Customisable prompter view
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Remote control from another device
- Save/Load from file functionality

## Developer Notes
- Although written using Bun, production builds currently must use "node-server". This is due to Server Side Events not working correctly
